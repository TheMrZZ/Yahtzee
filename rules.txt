===== RULES =====

The game consists of a number of rounds
In each round, a player gets three rolls of the dice, although they can choose to end their turn after one or two rolls.
After the first roll the player can save any dice they want and re-roll the other dice. This procedure is repeated after
the second roll. The player has complete choice as to which dice to roll. The Yahtzee scorecard contains 13 different
category boxes and in each round, after the third roll, the player must choose one of these categories. The score
entered in the box depends on how well the five dice match the scoring rule for the category. The game is completed
after 13 rounds by each player, with each of the 13 boxes filled. The total score is calculated by summing all thirteen
boxes, together with any bonuses.
The 13 boxes are divided in two sections :
         - The Upper section (6 boxes), where the score in each of these boxes is determined by adding the total
         number of dice matching that box.
         - The Lower section contains a number of poker-themed categories with specific point values
         If a category is chosen but the dice do not match the requirements of the category the player scores 0 in that category.
